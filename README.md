Clover Tovue is a todo list application built with Vite, Vue.js, and the Vuetify Vue Components Library. This application allows users to add, edit, search, filter, and sort todos. Additionally, it marks tasks/todos as important, due today, or overdue. The todo data is stored locally in LocalStorage.

## Personal Note

Dear HR Team at Wisatabook,

This project marks my first experience with the Vue.js framework. Although I typically work with React.js, I dedicated 5 days to learning and understanding Vue.js concepts, followed by 3 days to complete this project. I apologize for the delay in meeting the deadline and am truly grateful for the opportunity to participate in the Junior Software Engineer Technical Test.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Best regards,

[M HILAL BAGAS KELANA]
